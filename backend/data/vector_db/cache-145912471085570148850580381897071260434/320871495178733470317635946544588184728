Portfolio Management Best Practices

1. Diversification
   Spread investments across different asset classes to reduce risk.
   Include stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments.

2. Regular Rebalancing
   Review your portfolio quarterly and rebalance when allocation drifts.
   This maintains your target risk level and can improve returns.

3. Risk Management
   Assess your risk tolerance regularly and adjust as life circumstances change.
   Consider your investment horizon - longer horizons can support more risk.

4. Cost Management
   Minimize trading fees and expense ratios.
   Consider low-cost index funds for core holdings.
   Be tax-efficient with your trades.

5. Long-term Focus
   Don't panic sell during market downturns.
   Stay invested through volatility.
   Review your strategy annually but avoid frequent changes.
