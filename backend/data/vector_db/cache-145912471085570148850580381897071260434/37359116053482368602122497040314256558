Risk Management Strategies

Portfolio Risk Types:

1. Market Risk: Overall market movements affect portfolio value
   - Mitigation: Diversification across asset classes
   - Consider defensive positions during high volatility

2. Concentration Risk: Too much exposure to single investment
   - Mitigation: No single position should exceed 10-15% of portfolio
   - Regularly rebalance to maintain diversification

3. Liquidity Risk: Inability to quickly convert to cash
   - Mitigation: Maintain adequate cash reserves (3-6 months expenses)
   - Avoid illiquid investments unless long-term horizon

4. Interest Rate Risk: Changes in rates affect bond values
   - Mitigation: Ladder bond maturities
   - Consider floating rate bonds

5. Currency Risk: Exchange rate fluctuations
   - Mitigation: Hedge international positions
   - Consider currency-hedged funds

Risk Assessment Questions:
- What is your investment time horizon?
- How would you react to a 20% portfolio decline?
- Do you need income from investments now?
- What are your financial goals and priorities?
- Can you handle short-term volatility for long-term gains?
