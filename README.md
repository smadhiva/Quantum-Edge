# PRAVAHA FINANCE AI  
### 💰 A Live Agentic Multi-Portfolio Intelligence Copilot  
**Powered by Pathway Streaming RAG + Gemini**

> *“Pravaha” means flow — because intelligence should move as fast as the market.*

## 🚩 Problem Statement — Why This Matters

Financial portfolio management is inherently dynamic:

- Asset prices change continuously  
- Company fundamentals evolve with filings and disclosures  
- News impacts sentiment and risk instantly  
- Portfolio documents are updated frequently  

However, most existing portfolio tools and AI assistants rely on **static or batch-based data processing**.

### ❌ What’s Broken Today
- RAG systems treat data as snapshots  
- Any update requires re-embedding and re-indexing  
- AI assistants answer queries but do not continuously reason  
- Analysts manually cross-check dashboards and news  

👉 The core problem is **not intelligence**,  
👉 it is the lack of **continuous reasoning over live, evolving data**.

---

## ✅ Our Solution — PRAVAHA FINANCE AI

**Pravaha Finance AI** is a **live, multi-threaded, agentic portfolio copilot** that continuously monitors portfolios using **real-time market data and evolving documents**.

Instead of responding to isolated queries, the system maintains **persistent portfolio intelligence** that reacts automatically to data changes.

Key ideas:
- Each portfolio runs as an **independent execution thread**
- Intelligence is handled by a **coordinated multi-agent system**
- Context is always fresh through **streaming RAG**
- Decisions update automatically — no refresh, no restart

⚠️ This is **not a chatbot**  
⚠️ This is a **real-time financial decision system**
